/**
 * Feature 2 — reasoning / extended thinking.
 *
 * Sets `generateContentConfig.thinkingConfig { includeThoughts, thinkingBudget }`
 * and NOTHING else sampling-related: with extended thinking on, the Anthropic
 * converter strips `top_p`/`top_k` and any `temperature !== 1` (the API forbids
 * them), so this demo is kept separate from `sampling`.
 *
 * The harness collects `part.thought === true` parts into `thoughtText`, and
 * `usageMetadata.thoughtsTokenCount` surfaces how many tokens were spent
 * thinking.
